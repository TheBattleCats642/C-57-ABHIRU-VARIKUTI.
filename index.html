        Tim Berners-Lee, a visionary software engineer, is renowned for inventing the World Wide Web in 1989 while at CERN, revolutionizing global communication. He founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994 to establish universal web standards, emphasizing inclusivity and avoiding royalties. Berners-Lee's leadership at W3C has spurred technological innovation and an open web environment. He is a Professor at the University of Oxford, imparting knowledge to future computer scientists. Recognized for his impact, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001 and was knighted in 2004. His invention led to the rise of commercial browsers, like Internet Explorer, and paved the way for e-commerce, transforming society and the digital economy.</p>
